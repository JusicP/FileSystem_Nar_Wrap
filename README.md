# FileSystem_Nar_Wrap
Wrapper for using old filesystem_nar.dll with support for custom files.
Should work with the latest CSN:Z and CSO builds.
Some functions are not implemented, so the game may crash at any time or work incorrectly.
### Installation
1. First of all you need to compile FileSystem_Nar_Wrap project using VS2019(other versions not tested)
2. Move compiled filesystem_nar.dll to Bin folder of the game
3. Move filesystem_nar_orig.dll from repo to Bin folder
